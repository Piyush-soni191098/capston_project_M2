Data collection, data cleansing and manipulation, and EDA (experimental Data Analysis) are the three categories in which we are going to work with. The names of some of the columns, including hotel, is_canceled, lead_time, arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, arrival_date_week_number, arrival_date_day_of_month, and stays_In_weekend_nights, have been updated as the data collection process has progressed. As we proceed, we Identify the unique value for each column, and also verify the dataset type for each column. Identify some columns with inaccurate data types and will fix themaccording to as our need. As we discover duplicate items totaling 87396, which are later discarded from the dataset, duplicate data Items must also be removed during the data cleaning phase.\n",
